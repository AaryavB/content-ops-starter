      Cyberbullying is a growing concern affecting millions of young people worldwide. It includes harassment, threats, humiliation, and exclusion through digital platforms like social media, messaging apps, and online games.


      **What is Cyberbullying?**

      Cyberbullying is the use of technology to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target another person. Unlike traditional bullying, it can happen 24/7 and reach a victim even when they're alone.


      **Signs of Cyberbullying:**

      - Sudden changes in device use habits

      - Emotional distress during or after using the internet

      - Withdrawal from family and friends

      - Decline in academic performance

      - Reluctance to discuss online activities


      **How to Respond:**

      - Don't respond to the bully

      - Save evidence of the bullying

      - Block the person responsible

      - Report to a trusted adult or authority

      - Reach out for support

      **Key Insights from Our Interviews:**


      **Interview With Psychiatrist:**


      Adolescents in a higher socioeconomic group have more access to resources to cope with cyberbullying. For example, support systems, therapy, etc. However, adolescents in a lower socioeconomic group have comparatively less access to these tools, making it more difficult to cope.


      Bystanders play a major role in the impacts of cyberbullying, as they can also chose a side, and it is important that they do not promote cyberbullying, and instead chose to help the victim instead of contributing to the issue.


      Hurt is felt the same across genders and backgrounds, so it is important to be empathetic online.


      **Interview With Cyber Security Expert:**


      It is important to ensure that you act the same way in the cyberspace as you would in real life. If you would not do something or say something in real life, you should not be doing that or saying that online either.


      A user must also limit the access of their account, and limit the number of people who have access to the content they post, as this can significantly lower the chance of cyberbullying.
